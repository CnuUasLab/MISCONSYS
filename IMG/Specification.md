# IMG

# Introduction

The IMG portion of the code has a little more revamping to take care of since last year. The IMG portion of the system has a
lot of database management involved with the code that is written to validate data. Since there are special portions
of this we need to go over each section.

# MySQL Server

The use of a MySQL Server is cruicial to this task. One should be set up in the UAS Lab, but it would be good for you to set 
one up on your linux distributions in order to hold data about photos.
This is how we can categorize photos and then push them into the interoperability server using the mission interface. 

# Design

The following design is noted by the development of the different sections of the server. The MySQL Server is made up of two
seperate tables.
